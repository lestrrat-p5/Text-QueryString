# NAME

Text::QueryString - Fast QueryString Parser

# SYNOPSIS

    use Text::QueryString;

    my $tqs = Text::QueryString->new;
    my @query;

    @query = $tqs->parse("foo=bar&bar=baz");
    @query = $tqs->parse("foo=bar;bar=baz");
    @query = $tqs->parse("foo"); # foo => ""

# DESCRIPTION

WARNING: Still in ALPHA quality! Use at your own risk!

Text::QueryString is for when you need that speed to parse those punishingly
annoying query strings that they send to your webapp. The reason this
came to be is that we have encountered cases where we got hit by a performance 
degradation when moving from Apache based solution to Perl based solution.

Yes, normally just adding servers may be good, but since we were replacing
old code to new code in hopes that things would get better, this performance
degradation (while understandable because obviously C is much faster when
working with simple string like query strings) really made us feel sad.

So here's Text::QueryString. By default the XS version is built and loaded.
It will parse a given string, and run URI decoding on those values
(URI decoding was completely stolen from Dan Kogai's URI::Escape::XS), and
all is good.

It's your reponsibility to feed the results to whatever framework you're using. 
As an example: with `Plack::Request`, you might monkey patch the 
`query_parameter()` method like so:

    use Plack::Request;
    use Text::QueryString;
    no strict 'refs';
    my $tqs = Text::QueryString->new;
    *Plack::Request::query_parameter = sub {
        my $self    = shift;
        my $env     = $self->env;
        my $query   = $env->{'plack.request.query'};
        if ($query) {
            return $query;
        }
        $env->{'plack.request.query'} = Hash::MultiValue->new($tqs->parse($env->{QUERY_STRING}));
    };

There's a fallback pure-perl implementation in Text::QueryString::PP, but
this is basically just there to provide a fallback when things just don't work.
The code in Text::QueryString::PP was taken from URI::\_query and slightly
modified.
